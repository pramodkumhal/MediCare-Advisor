  <h2 class="text-center mb-4" style="color: #6734f3; font-weight: bold;">Building MediCare Advisor: A Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App</h2>

        <p>In today's fast-paced world, timely access to accurate healthcare information is more important than ever. MediCare Advisor was developed to provide a user-friendly platform where individuals can input their symptoms and receive reliable disease predictions, powered by machine learning.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #ee1414;">The Problem</h3>
        <p>Many people experience symptoms and are unsure about the potential illness behind them. Overlapping symptoms make it difficult to self-diagnose or even describe the problem accurately to medical professionals. MediCare Advisor addresses this challenge by providing a quick and convenient solution for symptom-based diagnosis.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #11f049;">The Solution</h3>
        <p>MediCare Advisor allows users to type in the symptoms they are experiencing. The application uses a pre-trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to predict the most likely disease based on the user's inputs. The workflow is simple:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Symptom Input:</b> Users type multiple symptoms separated by commas.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Learning Model:</b> The SVC model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and diseases.</li>
            <li><b>Prediction:</b> The system predicts the most probable disease from the entered symptoms.</li>
            <li><b>Additional Information:</b> Users receive helpful details including a description of the disease, precautions, medications, diet advice, and suggested workouts.</li>
        </ol>

  <h3 style="color: #fa0a96;">Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> Easy-to-use input and result display for a seamless experience.</li>
            <li><b>Accurate Predictions:</b> Machine learning ensures the predictions are reliable based on the dataset.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehensive Details:</b> Includes description, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts for each predicted disease.</li>
            <li><b>Educational Value:</b> Helps users learn more about symptoms and potential health conditions.</li>
        </ul>

  <h3 style="color: #F39334;">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>MediCare Advisor combines machine learning and healthcare knowledge to provide a convenient and reliable symptom-based diagnosis tool. It empowers users to better understand their health conditions and take informed steps towards wellness. This project reflects a step forward in making healthcare more accessible, accurate, and user-centric.</p>
